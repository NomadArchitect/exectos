## XT Development Kit (XTDK)
The XTDK, or XT Development Kit is a comprehensive set of headers designed to facilitate the development of both kernel
mode drivers and native XT applications. It includes two main headers: xtkmapi.h and xtumapi.h.

The xtkmapi.h header is primarily used for kernel mode development, specifically for building drivers. It provides
developers with the necessary definitions and functions required to interact with the kernel and access system
resources. With this header, developers can write efficient and secure kernel mode drivers for the XT operating system.

The xtumapi.h header is tailored for user mode development. It encompasses all the essential components needed for
creating user mode applications on the XT platform. This header exposes the definitions and public functions exported by
XTOS, allowing developers to leverage the capabilities of the operating system and build powerful user mode applications.

By utilizing XTDK, developers can harness the full potential of the XT operating system and seamlessly write both kernel
mode drivers and user mode applications. The provided headers streamline the development process by offering
a standardized set of functions and definitions, reducing the complexity and effort required to create software for the
XT platform.
